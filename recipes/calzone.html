    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A calzone is a half-moon shaped Italian turnover made by folding pizza dough over a filling of ricotta, mozzarella, and your choice of meats or vegetables, creating a sealed pocket of deliciousness.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pizza dough</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>½ cup diced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F and line a large sheet pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Divide pizza dough into 4 equal parts and roll each dough ball into a 1/4 inch thick circle.</li>
        <li>On half of each dough circle, add equal parts sauce, yellow onion, green bell pepper, and sliced pepperoni. Make sure to leave a little room around the edges so you can crimp the calzone shut.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the toppings with equal parts shredded cheese. Then fold the other half of the dough over the toppings and crimp the edges.</li>
        <li>Cut 2-3 air vents into the top of the calzone and place it on to the prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Brush with olive oil and bake for about 15 minutes or until the dough is fully cooked and the calzone is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Serve with warmed pizza sauce for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
